👋 Hi, I’m @katebygrace

👀 I’m interested in making things secure and scalable. I love learning almost anything - teach me something new! 

🌱 I’m currently learning k8s, and studying for the CKA. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some side projects. I'm an infrastructure person, but would love to set up a blog that looks reasonably nice! 

📫 How to reach me - If you have another means, signal, email etc, please use it! I will not be posting contact info here.
