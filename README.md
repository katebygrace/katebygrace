👋 Hi, I’m @katebygrace

👀 I’m interested in making things secure and scalable. I love learning almost anything - teach me something new! 

🌱 I’m currently learning container security.  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some side projects. I'm an infrastructure person, but would love to set up a blog that looks reasonably nice! 

📫 How to reach me - if you know, you know ;) If you don't, don't try.
